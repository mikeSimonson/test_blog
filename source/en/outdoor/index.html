        description: >
                    With a passion for adventure since I was a little boy, I never stopped climbing and travelling around
                    the world in search of new walls or mountains to climb.
                    Rather than focusing on a specific stream, <span class="color-text">I prefer trying everything</span>.
                    It's not uncommon then to find me <span class="color-text">bouldering, trad climbing, rock climbing,
                    ice climbing or mountaineering all over the world</span>.
                    In 2008, I founded the association "Climb 2 Climb" which main goal is to promote the climbing in Belgium.
                    Later, in 2009, I also became a <span class="color-text">climbing instructor</span> allowing me to improve
                    myself and especially to <span class="color-text">pass on my passion</span> other than through the internet.
                    Between guiding climbers on the cliffs and <span class="color-text">teaching science in general humanities</span>,
                    there was only one step. Today, nothing has changed. My association is still active, I teach and climb as much as before.
                    To stay motivated after so many years, <span class="color-text">I still have some great projects</span> I'm trying to achieve periodically.
