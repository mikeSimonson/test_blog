        name: My portrait
        description: |
                    With a Master's degree in biology but passionate with photography and mountain, I first edited
                    photos of others for the fun. 'Removing flaws and adding sparkle' was my motto. Over the years,
                    with practice, I gained experience and diversified into graphic design. Gradually, word of mouth
                    led me to design posters and logos for various clients and associations. Then, feeling the
                    opportunity to make a living out of my passion, I followed additional courses to complete my
                    training. Today I benefit from my mountaineer strenghts, my scientific rigour and my artist's eye
                    to offer new and professional creations tailored to the needs of my clients.
